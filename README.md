# SMS-Spam-Classification
The increased number of unsolicited emails known as spam has necessitated the development of increasingly reliable and robust antispam filters. Recent machine learning approaches have been successful in detecting and filtering spam emails. I need to classify Spam or ham from the dataset which is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam.

The main goal is to classify the message type as Spam or Ham.
